### Using grid layout
Grid layout is way better than flex or any other way to lay out elements. It seems much easier after I used it to create a very specific layout with clear purpose.
```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto;
}

.always_middle_column {
  grid-column: 2;
}

.first_row_wide {
  grid-row: 1;
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: 4;
}
```

### Better way to handle injectable class names
Haven't tested it yet in the field, but it seems like a good idea: build a static version of a component with hardcoded class names, then move the default implementations to `defaultProps` as values for properties. That way a component has a default look, but can be easily styled.
