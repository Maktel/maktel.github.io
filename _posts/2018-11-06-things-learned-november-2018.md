# 6 November 

### Editing old commit in git history
[so](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1186549)
```bash
git rebase --interactive <commit-sha>^
# choose with 'edit' commit you want to change
# make changes you would like to amend -- this apparently doesn't push changes to a current
# workspace, so you need to look at the specific commit history
git commit --all --amend --no-edit
git rebase --continue
```

### Stage lines with keyboard shortcut in git-gui
[so](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32661397/is-there-a-keyboard-shortcut-for-stage-lines-in-git-gui)
```bash
sudo gedit /usr/lib/git-core/git-gui
```

At the end of the file add
```
bind .   <$M1B-Key-d> stagelines

proc stagelines {} {
    apply_range_or_line %X %Y
    do_rescan
}
```

Now, restart git gui. Select lines you want to stage and press Ctrl+d. You can change keybind to sole d with `<Key-d>`.
